modx-manager-mockup
===================

After an early preview of the new MODX 2.3 Manager has been shown at MODXpo 2013 in Cologne, some very talented designers and agencies contributed mock-ups of their own vision for a new MODX manager. Since I now have used MODX for many projects and having designed and developed an ExtJS-based backend a few years ago by myself, I've made my own mock-up that I'd like to share with you.

So here is the result of my thoughts, that were highly inspired by mock-ups from the guys over at Sterc and EdenWeb.

One of my biggest concerns about the current MODX manager is that while developing a website with it, you cannot quickly switch between a document, a chunk, a snippet or even some security settings, without closing the active editor. I often find myself having several browser tabs open at once, that contain different manager pages. So I was thinking about how this could be improved and came up with the idea to have the manager open its manager pages in its own tabs. So when you want to edit a page, instead of reloading the whole manager with the page editor, just open a new tab for it. Same goes for chunks, snippets, plugins, even system settings, package management or security settings. You then can quickly switch between different manager pages, and if you're done, simply close the tab.
